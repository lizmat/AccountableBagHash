NAME
====

AccountableBagHash - be an accountable BagHash / MixHash

SYNOPSIS
========

    use AccountableBagHash;

    my %abh is AccountableBagHash = a => 42, b => 666;
    %abh<a> =  5; # ok
    %abh<a> = -1; # throws

    my %amh is AccountableMixHash = a => 3.14, b => 666;
    %amh<a> =  6.28; # ok
    %amh<a> = -1;    # throws
      
    CATCH {
        when X::BagHash::Acountable {
            say "You do not have enough {.key}";
            .resume
        }
    }

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module makes an `AccountableBagHash` / `AccountableMixHash` class available that can be used instead of the normal `BagHash` / `MixHash`. The only difference with a normal `BagHash` / `MixHash` is, is that if an attempt is made to set the value of a key to **less than 0**, that an exception is thrown rather than just deleting the key from the `BagHash` / `MixHash`.

Also exports a `X::BagHash::Accountable` error class that will be thrown if an attempt is made to set the value to below 0.
